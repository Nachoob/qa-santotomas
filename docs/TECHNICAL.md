# Certificate Verification System - Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Certificate Verification System is a web-based application designed to provide secure and reliable verification of digital certificates using QR codes and hash validation. The system implements various quality assurance practices to ensure reliability, security, and maintainability.

## Quality Assurance Practices Implemented

### 1. Input/Output Validation
- Form validation using Laravel's validation system
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security
- File type validation for certificate uploads
- Email format validation
- Date range validation for certificate validity

### 2. Error Handling and Exceptions
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error logging with context
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Transaction management for database operations

### 3. Traceability
- Complete audit trail of certificate operations
- IP address tracking
- User agent logging
- Timestamp recording
- User attribution for all actions

### 4. Version Control
- Git-based version control
- Semantic versioning
- Change history tracking
- Soft deletes for data recovery
- Database migrations for schema changes

### 5. Logging and Analysis
- Detailed error logging
- Operation logging
- Performance metrics
- Security event logging
- User activity tracking
